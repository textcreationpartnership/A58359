            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

I do not in the least doubt, before I put a <hi>Period</hi> to this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> fully to convince all, who are unprejudiced and <hi>considerate,</hi> that those very persons, who have long been, and still are, the <hi>Song</hi> of the <hi>Drunkard,</hi> the Subject of a Thousand Railleries and Reproaches in all <hi>Companies</hi> and <hi>Entertainments</hi> of <hi>True Papists,</hi> and false, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided, seduced <hi>Protestants,</hi> do yet really deserve the warm Affections and high Esteem of all <hi>Honest English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Good Protestants,</hi> and <hi>Discreetely Loyal Subjests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to their Vindication, it will not be amiss to premise by whom so many scandalous, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious <hi>Reports</hi> have been raised, by whom so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just groundless aspersions have been contrived, foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, propogated. After diligent enquiry, long obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and frequent converse with Persons of divers perswasions and qualities; I have arrived unto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in my own mind, that manifest declared <hi>Papists</hi> and others, not professedly such, but in reality friends unto and Correspondents with that Party, are the Persons who observe, aggravate, and spread all these Stories and opinions that are likely to weaken the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Interest,</hi> create misunderstandings between <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> of different apprehensions, thereby to embroil and if possible breed irreconcilable divisions and feuds amongst them; having thus sowed the seeds of Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and consequently of Destruction amongst us, how sedulously did they cultivate the weed, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46186:4"/> had they patience, in time might have effected their purpose, but the sprightly enterprizing <hi>Emissaries</hi> of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> finding their designes not ripen according to their expectation, have recourse to their own peculiar tried Acts of Lying <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> hopeing by these means to Extricate themselves out of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of their so often proved, so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrated, and fully detected Conspiracy, and to cast the <hi>Odium</hi> of their detestable principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices on such of the Innocent <hi>Protestants</hi> as were most zealous for their own Religion, or active against theirs, whose courage, Quality, Estates, or interest made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear formidable Adversaries, and likely to obstruct a hopeful design, which had been long hatching, was once neer the Birth, but by a train of <hi>Providences,</hi> miraculously discovered, and for them unhappily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. It were a difficult task to trace them through all their crooked <hi>Paths:</hi> no small labour to bring to light all their misterious hidden works of <hi>Darkness.</hi> Let us be content with our Ignorance of some few of their hellish <hi>Machinations,</hi> enough appearing to all whoare not voluntarily blind: and sufficient to render the <hi>Contrivers</hi> and <hi>Actors</hi> abominable, and as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom they were designed; thankful that we have been hitherto delivered from the effects of their <hi>Malice and Cruelty:</hi> It is high time to be jealous of them, we cannot be too watchful and Circumspect af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so many narrow escapes, which to recall unto your <hi>Memories</hi> would be a great piece of <hi>Impertinency,</hi> did not daily <hi>Experience</hi> manifest a sort of <hi>pretended Protestants</hi> who make it almost their <hi>sole Imployment</hi> to palliate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate, and if possibly, to obliterate out of our minds the remembrance of so formidable a <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> a <hi>Plot</hi> owned and stigmatized by <hi>His Majesty</hi> in divers <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> and by <hi>Four Successive Parliaments:</hi> The <hi>First</hi> of which was so far from being composed of <hi>Dissenters,</hi> that

            <p>Most of the forementioned objections have been so frequently and strenuously refuted that it is amazing any should have forehead enough to repeat them.

And a late Tryal, together with some expressions which the notoriety of the Fact, and irresistible power of Truth, extorted from our great Justiciary, hath somwhat dampt and checkt their hopes of stiffling the Popish Plot, that which they urge at present with most vigour is the abandoning of our Charter, a resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is necessary by reason of our unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable

            <p>It will be necessary in order to the more clear and distinct resolution of these Objections to give a summary account of the Nature and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Contents of our City Charter, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with some obvious suitable Reflections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then we appeal to all endued with Reason, who have any observation upon the vastly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effect of good and bad or no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whether this City hath cause voluntarily to resign that which above all other means hath most contributed to its Grandieur and security: and herein we may safely imitate <hi>Diogenes,</hi> whose generous freedom was commended by the great <hi>Alexander</hi> himself, which mighty Monarch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing between him and the Sun: Stand aside said he, and deprive me not of that which thou canst not impart unto me, meaning the benign influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of its Light and Heat. But to make good our promise of representing under one view, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our invaluable Charter, which is of so great Antiquity, that I know not from what time to reckon its date, for this City being by its

            </p>
            <p>It is also very remarkable, that their being so particularly comprehended in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> did supersede other Statute-Laws, made contradictory to the Liberty and Priviledges of the aforesaid City, as appears at large by the third Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Edward the third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The said Prince in his fifth Grant declares how sensible he is that his Navy was weakned by the Impoverishing of the City, and Decay of Trade therein; and thereupon grants them further Franchises for the Cities Welfare.</p>
            <p>And because so much depended upon Customs not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in written Records, but only derived by a long <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of Tradition from Times immemorial; and if the City were put upon the Proof, it might create them much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Expence. <hi>Edward the fourth</hi> granted unto them, that in all Pleas of or upon Customs of the City of <hi>London;</hi> tho the City or Government thereof be a party; The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>His Majesty now reigning, being sensible how much this City contributed to his Restauration, and how much its good Government, Wealth and Glory would establish his own Power and Dignity, confirmed all preceding Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Words as kind and comprehensive, as can be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on so solemn an Occasion, which being large and already published, I do thereunto refer the Reader. And from this Epitome of the various Charters and Concessions, together with the Circumstances of Time and Persons, we derive the ensuing Corollaries or Observations, which seem naturally to flow there from.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You may hence learn the great Antiquity of this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon which account with some People it should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more venerable.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46186:12"/>2. Observe the unanimous Consent of all Princes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and enlarge this Charter, apprehending, as is expresly in divers of their Concessions, that they did thereby not only benefit the City, but derive Honour and Advantage upon themselves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That very few of our Kings have attempted to destroy or suspend the Exercise of this Charter, and those who did, laid thereby the Foundation of great Troubles, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thereupon ensued.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Divers wise Princes, tho highly provok'd, and just Pretences afforded them, for ever to have abolished it, if they had regard only to the Persons, more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd therein, yet providently discerning the Benefit accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themselves, and the Nation thereby, did not only confirm but adorn it with new Priviledges.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is hard to conceive how this Charter can be forfeited since it hath not only the Concession of Kings, but the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Parliaments, <hi>That no Part thereof shall be forfeited by Abuse or Disuse:</hi> probably for seeing that some powerful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister or ill-advised Prince might from a Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge or Avarice pretend a Breach of the Charter, and thereupon Forfeiture, and then the Lease must be renewed, or the Tenure voided; whereas nothing is more rational, than that, if any Misdemeanour be committed by any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of a Society, the Criminals only should suffer, and not the rest of the innocent Community; therefore in many of our Charters the Sheriffs, Mayor and other Officers are declared accomptable and punishable for great Offences as other Subjects.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is most apparent that this City was never more peaceable and obsequious, or more contented under the Government of any Prince, from the Time it was erected, than now under that of his present Majesty, whose Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Justice, as it affords us an entire Satisfaction, so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46186:12"/> in our present Circumstances renders us so uneasy, as the continual Fears, we shall not long enjoy a King so unexceptionably good, who hath reconciled the two seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Extreams of Majesty and Love; exercising with the Wisdom and Authority of a Mighty Prince, the Care and Indulgence of an Affectionate Parent, not only of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but more especially of this City, which he hath honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, enriched, and secured, by chusing it for the Place of his almost constant Residence.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Dissolution of this Charter will be succeeded with such a train of Mischiefs and Calamities, as the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection thereon, will possess an honest considerate Man with terror and amazement, one might write a large Volume of the evil Effects and Consequences which would probably ensue, to foresee and enumerate all which, were next to an Impossibility; but so much as is obvious, makes it an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of Confusion, and an Emblem of the last Catastrophe of the Universe, or of the first Chaos: And therefore our most Gracious Prince, is certainly either ignorant of those Proceedings against us, or there is somewhat Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous which we cannot comprehend; but having had such long experience of his Majesty's benign Humour, and certain knowledg of his Propensity to gratify this City in all their reasonable Requests, let us never fear that he will in a moment pluck up by the Root, what was planted and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by so many of his wise magnanimous Predecessors, and to those, towards whose Prosperity his Majesty himself hath not meanly contributed. Let us therefore trust God and his Vicegerent, and discharging our Duties to both, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all Carking sollicitous Thoughts. But like Innocent Persons, chearfully expect a good Event of this, as of all our other Affairs. Howsoever, I apprehend, it will not be amiss, before I close my Discourse on this Subject, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse a few of those manifold Inconveniences which will
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46186:13"/> necessarily ensue upon the Forfeiture or Abrogation of our Charter, for the instruction of those silly Gulls, who would perswade us voluntarily to abandon all these Franchises, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and Emoluments; which by a long Series and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Services, a great stock of Merit hath been gained. It is some excuse to alleg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>, in order to extenuate our Follies, that we are drunk, therefore in Charity we will suppose these Men drunk with Loyalty; but withal I question not, but before I leave them, to make it evident, that none are or can be good Subjects, till they do own and maintain his Majesty's legal Prerogative as their own Property; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so their Fellow Subjects just Liberties and Privileges, as their own Estates and Lives. But there is amongst us a worse sort of Men, who for base sinister Ends would dissolve the present Constitution of Government, for that none, who know them, will give their Votes towards their obtaining any share in this; they hope, in the new Model, to become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, and thereupon censure and declaim against the Present; like the mad Philosopher, who would be buried with his Face downwards, fancying the World would be turned topsy turvy, then all the rest would lie wrong, and he alone right. To inform the former Rank of <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muses,</hi> and bring that confusion upon the latter unto which they would reduce us, I shall endeavour to represent the Result of this so much desired and expected Reformation. It is supposed, which yet I can scarcely perswade my self to believe, that some, even among the Governors of our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, are no strangers to, and will not be much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with this designed Alteration; let them consider, that the Aldermen, who in the present established Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are very considerable (those above the Chair Justices of course, and of the highest Rank) will be levelled with the meanest Commoner, liable to be Collectors, Pettit-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables, and other Offices of the lowest Degree; those who
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46186:13"/> expect to be Mayors, deprived of so honourable and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table an Employ; those who have been degraded, as I may say, and on even ground with other Plebeans. A great part of the Revenues of the City forfeit by Statutes of Mortmain, or revert to the Original Donors, their Heirs or Executors. The Commonalty, besides all the Miseries which attend Anarchy, liable to Pressing, to go abroad on War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, from which, by their Charters, they are exempted; not capable, with that ease and advantages of recovering their Debts, exposed to Vexatious Suits, Pleas of the Crown, now being decided in their own Courts, by their own Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. Aliens will dwell in their City, learn the Mystery of all their Trades, and have equal Advantages with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. No provision for Widows, who abandoned Dower or Jointures, and left to the Custom and Courtesy of the City: Orphans Mony hazardous, if not lost, with not only injury to Citizens, but to many worthy Gentlemen, whose Daughters will be left to great Uncertainties. To say nothing of Freemens Widows and Children, who thereby enjoy great Privileges, to be rescinded. And not to expatiate on their Estates in the Stocks and Treasuries of private Companies, and the Revenues of the said Companies; Revenues and Government of Hospitals. What Confusion and Loss will ensue the intermission of the Offices of Conservators of the River, and Water-balywick; of Packing, Scavage, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, Garbling, Gauging, measuring Coal, Corn, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To pass over Prizage of Wine, Markets, Escheats, Profits, and Emoluments from <hi>Leaden-Hall,</hi> and other publick Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from weighing, approving, laying, housing divers Commodities; forestalling, ingrossing. But these are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Damages, and are all nothing to what the whole City is at once liable to: We may become a Garison, or rather a Camp; and if we lose the benefit of chusing our Sheriffs, our Lives, Liberties, Estates, lie at the Mercy of such as shall be imposed on us.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:46186:14"/>
            <p>These, and innumerable other Mischiefs we are liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if the Charter be rendred invalid; which though we have little cause to fear, during the Administration of our present Sovereign, who hath never hitherto manifested his Power, by embracing Opportunities of oppressing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his Subjects: Yet having no possibility of ensuring his Life, who knows what conditioned Princes may succeed him; and we ought, if we can prevent it, to leave nothing to Chance. Let us therefore highly prize our Priviledges, and by all legal Means, maintain that precious Patrimony left us by our Forefathers; behave our selves with all duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful respect to our King, that he may not be induced, by the Importunity of our Enemies, to take every Advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. And let us cherish mutual Love among our selves; A Society, no more than a Kingdom, divided, can long subsist. Let every one mind his own Business, and that of the Publick, when legally called thereunto; but let all be transacted without clamour, railing, reviling, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, meekness, regularly. As I would have none to betray their just Privileges, so neither to claim more than is their Due; for to arrogate more to our selves than is right, is the ready way to lose what we might otherwise justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. I am unwilling, and almost afraid of recapitulating the Inconveniences will by this Resumption redound unto the Supream Magistrate: The old and too too often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Sentence is, <hi>Necesse est ut multos metuat quem multi timent;</hi> when People are put out of the protection of those Laws they value and like, they are not free or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to give due subjection to those, whereof they do not in their secret thoughts approve, though outward Respects restrain them from declaring it. The next favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opportunity, or Invitation, whereby they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their Losses, or recover their Liberties, is usually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced; of which <hi>Richard</hi> the second is an eminent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46186:14"/> Instance. When I consider all this, and much more, fit rather for private Thoughts, or communication to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ministers, than for common Discourse, I am great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprized to find what progress is already made in this Affair, and from what Miscarriage, or pretended Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the City, it derived its Original. I cannot find any specious colour for this new sort of Inquisition, besides that common Complaint of our Adversaries, That so long as the City chuses Sheriffs, and they assign Juries, the King's most Excellent Majesty, and his most Loyal faithful Subjects, must despair of Justice. Upon which Theme, (good God!) how copious and elegant are they! How clearly and fully do they prove their Charge by induction of Particulars! How many <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Juries! How many honest useful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons brought into trouble, only for their exposing Persons Disaffected, and Actions displeasing to the Government! This, if it be true, all must account a very hainous Crime, and not to be expiated by a less Punishment, than that which they have allotted for it. But if to be accused, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Criminal, how few would be Innocent! We shall therefore impartially examine all their Allegations, and if I do not demonstrate the falseness and futility of them, or at least if I do not, without reserve or disguise, really believe what I declare to others hereof, may I suffer greater Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and worse Punishments, than those I would depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for, and avert from this Renowned City, in which I first drew my Breath: wherein I have led the most comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table part of my Life, and which I hope, dying, to leave to my Posterity, more advanced in Reputation and Prosperity, than when I first entred therein. May it be and continue the deserved Metropolis of so great an Empire, the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of so good a King; the impregnable Bulwark of the best Religion; the Glory of the most truly generous and easily governable Nation; the worst indeed of Slaves, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46186:15"/> the best of Subjects; which Character may they deserve and maintain, whilst they are a People, as they have for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 1600 Years already elapsed. <hi>Britanni di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus,</hi>

            <p>Having finished what I proposed to represent concerning our Charter, I proceed, according to my promise, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, to vindicate our Modern Sheriffs and Jurors, whom our Adversaries load with Reproaches, and brand with no less Crimes than Disloyalty and Perjury: From which Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous Accusations, since we cannot clear our selves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recriminating, let indifferent Persons judg who have the better Cause and Plea. There is nothing certainly more obvious to all considering People, than that we are beset by a company of Men, who since they dare not attempt the destroying us by Force, do therefore endeavour to compass and effect it by Tricks and Fraud. And it were endless to recount the Ways and Methods which they have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, for the subversion of our Religion, Laws, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to make us fall a Sacrifice to their Rage, under the charge and imputation of Crimes, whereof their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences tell them we are altogether Innocent. It were too bold an effort directly to trample upon the English Laws, and therefore they are thinking how to make them as insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant to the protection of the Guiltless, as if we never had enjoyed any Laws, or were deprived of them by a Right of Conquest. Nor doth any thing occur to their Thoughts, that would be more inservient hereunto, than the obtaining Sheriffs, that they are assured would return such Juries, who would reckon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:46186:15"/> Destruction of the King, the Subversion of the established Government. And after all the Clamour that hath been raised against the late Sheriffs, and those Juries which they have returned to serve either in Capital or Civil Causes; We defie the utmost of the Malice of our Enemies, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance one just Exception against the Righteousness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of their several and respective Verdicts. Alas what kind of Juries are those returned in the Neighbouring Counties, at which nevertheless no Offence is taken, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of those, that have been from time to time upon the Pannels in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us but ballance the Acquitment of <hi>Gascoign</hi> and <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> with the <hi>Ignoramus</hi>'s returned either at the Best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Colledg,</hi> or that against the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sober Man must acknowledg, that if it be lawful to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign a Jury, there is more to be objected to the disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those, than there is to asperse these.</p>
            <p>Nor can there be a greater Evidence of the Integrity and Justice of the late Juries, than that they have carried it equally towards all sorts of Persons: for did not the Jury in March 1681 bring in an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon a Bill exhibited against diverse Persons, under a pretence of Recusancy; and this, not because they favoured them or the Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but because the Evidence was not full, or the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses such, as a wise and honest Man ought to believe?</p>
            <p>And is it not strange, that the Jury which rejected the Bill against the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> should be so severely blamed, when it is so well known, that the principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons then in Commission on the Bench have often said, that they must have done as the Jury did, had it been their Lot to have been in their Place?</p>
            <p>Can any Thing tend more to the Vindication of the late Juries, than that they have never failed to give Verdicts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these of their own Principles, and their best Friends,
<pb facs="tcp:46186:16"/> if the Evidence before them appeared any ways clear and full, and that the Witnesses were such, as that credit could be given to them; Witness the Case some time ago against <hi>Francis Smith,</hi> and that of late against Mr. <hi>Best.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are any so unreasonable as to expect, that a Jury should find Bills upon the Depositions of such as themselves know to be perjured and infamous Rascals? and of this complexion and stamp were most of those that swore against the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> Or would they have a Jury convict a Person, upon the Testimony of a Woman, that would not declare and express her self in the very Court, but as she was prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, nor without asking her Suborner what she should say next, as in the case of <hi>Sam.

            <p>Finally, What Jurors did ever better merit the Character of good and legal Men, than those, whereof our Grand Juries have been mostly composed? Men of good Fame, free from all reasonable Suspicion of any Design for themselves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, upon the Estates or Lives of any suspected Criminals, or had any Quarrel or Controversy with any of them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, impartial, of sufficient Understanding and Estate. Let us compare their Verdicts with those, of any which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded them in <hi>London</hi> in our Memory, and I perswade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, they will not be disgraced by the parallel. Nor shall we decline to challenge the adjacent Counties, whether they can produce Verdicts founded on more Reason, or where the Jurors acted with more deliberation and indifferency: I am ashamed to nominate them in the same breath with our sprightly inspired Association-abhorring Jurors; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Persons on Reputation of I know not whom; whereas it is customary with ours to refuse Bills from other Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, unless they reexamin the Evidence; These, tho absent, with a breath condemn, whom the most judicious Jury ever sate in <hi>London,</hi> upon fair and strict Inquiry, acquitted; to the full Satisfaction of hundreds of honourable Persons there present.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:46186:16"/>
            <p>I intended to have enumerated all the remarkable Verdicts given within these two Years last past, whereof I have a most particular Account, with the Reasons and Motives inducing them; but I being prolix, and what I have already specified, being, in my Opinion, their sufficient Apology, I shall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persede that Task, and conclude, after I have remembred you how great a Trust and Power is lodged in Juries; so that as a Modern Judicious Author, wisely observes, <hi>That 'tis the greatest in the Nation, next to the Legislative; the Concernments of all Commoners; the Honour, Reputation, Estates, and Lives of the Nobility is submitted to their Censure: Their Duty is to Indict Offend rs, and protect the Innocent in their Reputations, Lives, and Interests, from false Accusers, and malicious Conspirators.</hi> Of how great Consequence is it then unto us all, to have good Juries? How carefully ought we to provide for the Security of our Lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> against such as would destroy us by false Accusation and Perjury? And except our Sheriffs be wise, careful, and integruous, we may prognosticate great Hazards to divers Persons, whom we cannot but believe in our Consciences to be innocent of those Crimes whereof their Adversaries would soon charge them, could they obtain Juries like to prove so severe, as those were lately to <hi>Wilmore</hi> and Sheriff <hi>Pilkington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, my dear fellow-Citizens, what remains, but that I should exhort you strenuously to assert and maintain your undoubted right of chusing She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs. Be not afrighted by Menaces, or wheedled by Promises of an Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to part with so essential and necessary a Branch of your Charter; which should you neglect or resign, (pardon the harshness of the Expression) you will thereby become Traitors to the Community, and Violaters of that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Trust which you are obliged by your Interest, and engaged by your Oaths, faithfully &amp; fearlesly to discharge. Nay, tho Persons of the greatest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority amongst you should interpose, let not that influence you to abandon your Unvaluable Privileges, and complement you selves into Misery; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they who, by misrepresentation, have raised such jealousy and distrust of you, will, when they have obtained, by this Incroachment, an almost De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotick Power, exercise it in a manner will not be very agreeable, and afford you sufficient cause bitterly to lament your unaccountable, your unexcusable Credulity and Folly, and will render you mean in the Eyes of them you have gratified, hateful and abhorred to those you betray. As for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards your Duty and Love to your Prince, these will be more signalized by your putting a value upon his Gifts, than by your slighting and rejecting them. And indeed we cannot reasonably believe or imagine his Majesty will require our subjecting our selves; and all we have, unto his Absolute Will and Pleasure, he having ever hitherto preferred an upright equal Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before an unlimited Domination; and that humane benign temper, wherein he excels all Men, will certainly dispose him to pardon us if we cannot, dare not repose that confidence in his Ministers we could in himself. The best and wisest of Princes, see most Transactions with other Mens Eyes,
<pb facs="tcp:46186:17"/> hear with their Ears, and Act by their Hands; the concealing Addition, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Word in Speech, or Circumstance in Actions, we may daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, renders Cases very different from what they were really: Therefore having so many, and such powerful Enemies, as I have before demonstrated, our only Security is, the established Law, by which we are governed; and we have his Majesty's Royal Word, that shall be the Rule of all his Actions, and equally distributed to all his Subjects. Whilst the Laws have free course, and are uncontrouled by Justiciaries, duly interpreted, faithfully represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that Sheriffs take care to return equal Juries, no Innocent need fear. Our Adversaries may accuse us, brand us with odious Names and Characters, or at worst, imprison us; but the Law, which is impartial, cannot be brib'd or biass'd, and our honest Neighbours will soon relieve us. Nay, let the whole Fraternity of tutor'd Witnesses appear against the meanest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, whose Cause is just, I question not, but our discerning Juries will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily detect the Fraud, and acquit the Oppressed. Birds that have once escaped the Snare, are not easily entangled again. The same Cheat, in the same Age, must not be brought often upon the Stage; or if it be again represented, what Impunity its Actors promise themselves, or what Encouragement and Assurances they may receive from others, I know not; but unless we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously blind and infatuated, they cannot, methinks, reasonably hope for success. Let us then cheerfully unite in this laudable Resolution, to chuse such Magistrates for the Year ensuing, as are endued with Wisdom and Courage, who have obtained a good Report for their Dutifulness to their Sovereign, and Love to their Fellow-Citizens; who are uncapable of being by either Side biassed and corrupted; Men actively prudent, honestly zealous, of brave, firm, manly Resolutions; who will not be afraid to discharge their Duty in in the fullest and utmost extent. If Almighty God hath designed our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, he will provide Persons thus qualified, and inspire and animate us to elect them. And such Ministers will be not only a great Security to the City, in this time of great Fear and extremest Exigence, but doutbless very acceptable to his Majesty, whose most admirable Humanity, and tender Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his People, will certainly dispose him to pity a distracted City, upon the brink of Ruine, by reason of Jealousies and Divisions; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at our Choice of vertuous, peaceable, discreet Sheriffs, who may greatly contribute to the accommodating our Differences, removing our mutual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and Mistakes; whereby this City will be rendred more capable of serving his Majesty, and relishing the Blessings of his mild benign Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a commendable Emulation will be excited, who shall manifest most dutiful Respect unto his Royal Person, and most liberally contribute to the Support of his Government: And being delivered from the fear of our Enemies, we shall join in celebrating his Praises, continually supplicating him b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
